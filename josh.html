    <p>I am a 24 year old speed skater who has been skating for 14 years. I am also a former National Training partner, World Cup Alternate and 5k/10k specialist.

    <p>I am growing because to me Movember is one of the biggest reminders of men's physical and mental health, something that so many people often forget and tend to neglect.
      Movember is an opportunity for me to remind myself and others of men's mental health issues and the stigma behind it, something myself, friends, and family have struggled with.
