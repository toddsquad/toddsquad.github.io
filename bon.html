      <p>I am 20 years old and have been speed skating for 17 years. I grew up in Saskatoon and moved to Calgary in 2021 to study political science and continue speed skating.
        I enjoy listening to music and can even play the saxophone.

      <p>I'm growing this Movember because mental health and cancer affects us all. Whether it's you personally or someone you know, we've all experienced it.
