    <p>I have been speed skating for 17 years and have always loved playing all kinds of sports.
      I spent four years training in Montr√©al for Short Track speed skating before moving back to Calgary and joining the Todd Squad.
    </p>
    <p> I'm growing this Movember because I have family and friends who have struggled with mental health issues.
      They did not have the knowledge or resources to help themselves,
      so I hope that initiatives created by the Movember organization will help promote healthy relationships between men.
