    <p>I'm 22 years old and have been speed skating for 17 years. I grew up all over western Canada and recently
      spent four years living in Montr√©al. I moved out east to train for Short Track speed skating, and also began my studies in computer science. 
      I have now moved back to Calgary, joined the Todd Squad, and am planning to continue my studies next year.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> I'm growing this Movember because I have family and friends who have struggled with mental health issues.
      They did not have the knowledge or resources to help themselves,
      so I hope that initiatives created by the Movember organization will help promote healthy relationships between men, 
      and provide resources for those that need them.
